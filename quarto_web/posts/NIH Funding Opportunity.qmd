## Part 2: Full Text of Announcement

### Section I: Background and Objectives

Describing the background, the need for tools to enhance genomic and non-genomic data analysis in predicting diseases.

### Section II: Award Information

$4.8 million is committed to fund 2-4 awards, each with a limit of $1.6 million per year for a duration of five years.

### Section III: Eligibility Information

Includes a range of US institutions, both academic and profit-oriented.

## MAGen Project's Goals & Activities

1. Develop ML/AI tools integrated with an ELSI framework for genomic research.
2. Select and focus on at least 4 candidate genes with pathogenic variants.
3. Lead development and cross-validation of tools for specific genes.
4. Address ELSI issues related to ML/AI in genomic medicine applications.

## Participation and Roles

PD/PIs are to lead the project responsibly, while NIH will have a significant role in steering the committee and other activities.

## Review Criteria

Applications will be reviewed based on Significance, Investigators, Innovation, Approach, and Environment, with additional considerations for compliance and protection of human subjects.

Applications proposing new primary data generation or without an ELSI plan will be deemed non-responsive.

## Data Sharing

Compliance with NIH data sharing policies is mandatory.

## Section VII: Agency Contacts

Lists contacts for scientific, financial, and submission-related inquiries.

## Section VIII: Other Information

Notes that recent policy notices might affect applications and provides necessary links to regulations.

### Authority

The funding is made under sections `301` and `405` of the Public Health Service Act.
