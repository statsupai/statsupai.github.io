The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has developed a [Strategic Plan for Data Science](https://datascience.nih.gov/nih-strategic-plan-data-science), initially launched in 2018, to modernize and enhance NIH-funded biomedical data science. The plan aims to improve the storage, management, standardization, and accessibility of biomedical data, ensuring it supports accelerated scientific discovery and medical innovation.


Key focus areas include:

- **Findability and Interoperability**: Enhancing the discoverability and interconnectivity of NIH-funded data sets to support broader scientific use.
- **Tool Integration**: Developing new data management tools and integrating existing ones to improve accessibility and efficiency.
- **Algorithm and Tool Accessibility**: Transforming academic innovations into robust, user-friendly resources that meet industry standards.
- **Cost Management**: Addressing the rising costs associated with data storage and management.

The NIH invites ongoing community input to refine and implement the strategic goals. For more details, visit the [NIH Office of Data Science Strategy website](https://datascience.nih.gov/) or contact them directly at [datascience@nih.gov](mailto:datascience@nih.gov).
