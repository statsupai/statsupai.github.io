## Event Recap

The **Challenges in Neuroimaging Data Analysis** workshop, hosted by the Institute for Mathematical and Statistical Innovation (IMSI), took place from **August 26–30, 2024**. The event brought together leading researchers in neuroimaging and data analysis to discuss the mathematical and statistical challenges associated with large-scale neuroimaging datasets.

### Key Highlights:
- **Plenary Talks**: Thought-provoking plenary sessions were delivered by experts such as **Markus Axer** from the Research Centre Jülich, and **Hanchuan Peng** from the Institute for Brain and Intelligence, exploring brain connectivity and high-resolution imaging.
- **Sessions on Cutting-Edge Techniques**: The workshop featured sessions on topics like **deep learning for brain connectome analysis**, **dynamic brain networks**, and **causal inference in neuroimaging**.
- **Poster Session**: Early-career researchers had the opportunity to present their work in a poster session, with topics ranging from **functional brain connectivity** to **neuroimaging genetics**.

The workshop served as a platform to address the rapidly growing need for advanced statistical techniques in neuroimaging, essential for the continued progress in understanding brain disorders and developing new treatments.
