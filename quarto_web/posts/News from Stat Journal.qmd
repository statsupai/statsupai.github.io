Dr. Dette has been an integral part of **Stat** since its launch in 2012, serving as an Editor, and he has also contributed to other esteemed journals such as Metrika, Bernoulli, and the Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference. He is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, and an Elected Member of the International Statistical Institute.

Dr. Dette succeeds **Hao Helen Zhang** as Editor-in-Chief. We extend our gratitude to Helen for her exceptional leadership and dedication to the journal over the past five years.

### Call for Papers: Special Issue on Statistics for Large Language Models

**Stat** invites submissions for a special issue focused on "Statistics for Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Language Models for Statistics." LLMs have become a transformative advancement in AI, influencing research, education, and daily work. We welcome submissions on a wide array of topics, including but not limited to:

1. Application of LLMs to statistical challenges such as text-based hypothesis testing, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and text classification.
2. Statistical perspectives on LLMs, including their development and evaluation.
3. Probabilistic interpretations of LLMs and implications for inference and uncertainty quantification.
4. Use of LLMs in scientific discoveries across fields like oceanography, environmental science, and biomedicine.
5. Development of trustworthy LLMs with statistical methods ensuring privacy, fairness, transparency, interpretability, and robustness.
6. Adapting statistics education to incorporate LLMs and generative AI.
7. AI governance and transparency.
