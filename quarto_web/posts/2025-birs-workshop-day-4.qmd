**Introduction:** 
Genome-wide association studies are essential for uncovering single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with complex diseases. However, current approaches often struggle to detect regional associations, especially when individual variant effects are small and widely dispersed, leading to limited statistical power and inflated type I error rates. We propose a novel and powerful method that addresses these challenges by first quantifying the regional association strength at each single nucleotide polymorphism. These values are then transformed into a time series, allowing us to apply change point detection techniques to identify significant genomic regions. Through extensive simulations, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches, showing over a 20% improvement in power under difficult scenarios‚Äîparticularly when causal variants are sparse and multiple association regions co-exist. It also achieves a notably lower false positive rate across all tested conditions. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development‚Ñ† (ABCD¬Æ) study, identifying genomic regions associated with the Brief Problem Monitor. This work is a collaboration with Dr. Yiran Jiang.

**Introduction:** 
The exponential growth of biomedical literature necessitates advanced tools for efficient knowledge integration and discovery. Knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as a powerful solution, yet transforming unstructured text into accurate, structured representations remains a major challenge. In this talk, we present iKraph, a large-scale biomedical KG constructed using an award-winning information extraction pipeline applied to all PubMed abstracts. Our approach achieves human-level accuracy in knowledge extraction, surpassing manually curated databases in coverage. To enhance comprehensiveness, we integrated relations from 40 public databases and high-throughput genomics data, enabling rigorous evaluation of automated knowledge discovery. We further developed an interpretable, probabilistic inference method to identify indirect causal relationships, demonstrating its utility in real-time COVID-19 drug repurposing. To facilitate broader use, we provide a cloud-based platform (https://biokde.insilicom.com) offering access to this structured knowledge and analytical tools. This work highlights the transformative potential of high-accuracy KGs in accelerating biomedical research and drug discovery.

**Introduction:** 
We present ongoing work for the development of an agentic AI system to optimize anesthesiology staff scheduling across Yale-New Haven Hospital‚Äôs multi-site operating rooms. Manual scheduling processes currently consume significant clinical and administrative time, contribute to inefficiencies, and limit adaptability to real-time changes. By automating daily assignments, forecasting Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA) availability, and optimizing long-horizon staffing plans, this system could reduce OR idle time, cut locum costs, and reclaim over $1M annually in clinician time. Our agentic AI framework consists of coordinated modules each functioning as a decision-making agent that dynamically forecasts demand, assigns staff, and adapts schedules in real-time based on constraints and availability.

org="University of Toronto" 
summary="Spline-based statistical curve models combined with distribution-based metric scaling more accurately reconstruct 3D chromatin architecture from Hi-C data, including sparse single-cell assays."

**Introduction:** 
Reconstructing three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure from conformation capture assays (such as Hi-C) is a critical task in computational biology, since chromatin spatial architecture plays a vital role in numerous cellular processes and direct imaging is challenging. Most existing algorithms that operate on Hi-C contact matrices produce reconstructed 3D configurations in the form of a polygonal chain. However, none of the methods exploit the fact that the target solution is a (smooth) curve in 3D: this contiguity attribute is either ignored or indirectly addressed by imposing spatial constraints that are challenging to formulate. In this paper we develop both B-spline and smoothing spline techniques for directly capturing this potentially complex 1D curve. We subsequently combine these techniques with a Poisson model for contact counts and compare their performance on a real data example. In addition, motivated by the sparsity of Hi-C contact data, especially when obtained from single-cell assays, we appreciably extend the class of distributions used to model contact counts. We build a general distribution-based metric scaling ( DBMS ) framework from which we develop zero-inflated and Hurdle Poisson models as well as negative binomial applications. Illustrative applications make recourse to bulk Hi-C data from IMR90 cells and single-cell Hi-C data from mouse embryonic stem cells.

**Introduction:** 
Synthetic data, for instance generated by foundation models, may offer great opportunities to boost sample sizes in statistical analysis. However, the distribution of synthetic data may not be exactly the same as that of the real data, thus incurring the risk of faulty inferences. Motivated by these observations, we study how to use synthetic data in a fundamental statistical setting, that of predictive inference, i.e., predicting future classes or outcomes with prediction sets. The standard approach in the field, conformal prediction, tends to provide uninformative prediction sets when calibration data are scarce. This paper introduces Synthetic-powered predictive inference (SPI), a novel framework that incorporates synthetic data---e.g., from a generative model---to improve sample efficiency. At the core of our method is a score transporter: an empirical quantile mapping that aligns nonconformity scores from trusted, real data with those from synthetic data. By carefully integrating the score transporter into the calibration process, SPI provably achieves finite-sample coverage guarantees without making any assumptions about the real and synthetic data distributions. When the score distributions are well aligned, SPI yields substantially tighter and more informative prediction sets than standard conformal prediction. Experiments on image classification---augmenting data with synthetic diffusion-model generated images---and on the medical expenditure panel survey (MEPS) dataset demonstrate notable improvements in predictive efficiency in data-scarce settings.

**Introduction:** 
The rapid expansion of large-scale proteomic resources has enabled the discovery of thousands of protein-phenotype associations. Yet, the scientific bottleneck lies in translating these vast summary-level statistics into structured biological insight and actionable knowledge. This talk introduces an AI co-scientist framework designed to scale the human reasoning process of protein-disease interpretation. Drawing inspiration from the way human researchers integrate statistical findings with prior scientific knowledge, our agentic system performs a multi-stage workflow: planning report sections, querying curated knowledge bases, reasoning over pathway enrichment and literature evidence, and generating text-based summaries. The system combines domain-specific tools with large language models in a united paradigm to automate knowledge synthesis at scale. We demonstrate applications across various diseases, highlighting how AI co-scientists can accelerate biomedical discovery, enhance reproducibility, and support drug development through more systematic and scalable scientific writing.
