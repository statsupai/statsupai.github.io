The **Stats Up AI** group is excited to announce the **‚ÄúStatistical and AI Methods for Health Data Science‚Äù** seminar series. This online seminar series will feature topics in various domains of health data science, including data in **neuroimaging**, **genomics**, **EHRs**, etc. Data analysis in these fields poses significant challenges, encompassing the breadth of **statistics**, **machine learning**, and **AI**. Our series, led by experts in these areas, aims to introduce these challenges, as well as current solutions and data analysis workflows.

**Hope to see many of you!**

Best,

### Ying Guo: *Exploring Brain Function and Connectivity with fMRI*

**Date:** Thursday, May 8, 2025  
**Time:** 3:00 PM ‚Äì 4:00 PM EST  
**Zoom Registration:** [https://upenn.zoom.us/j/99182616852](https://upenn.zoom.us/j/99182616852)

**Talk Summary:**  
This talk introduces key analytical and statistical methods for studying brain function and connectivity using fMRI, with a focus on **brain networks** and **connectome analysis** through **statistical and AI-based approaches**. It aims to familiarize researchers with theanalysisunique characteristics of fMRl data, commonworkflows, and key challenges, encouraging greatercontributions from the statistics community.


#### Abstract

Neuroimaging technology has played a central role in advancing scientific understanding of normal brain function in humans, as well as in investigating the neural basis of psychiatric and neurological disorders. Among the various neuroimaging techniques, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is one of the most commonly used tools in current neuroscience studies.  This talk aims to introduce analytical techniques and statistical methods for investigating brain function and connectivity using fMRI. We will begin with a discussion of the background and key characteristics of fMRI data that are relevant to statistical modeling. This will be followed by an overview of fMRI analysis, with a focus on brain network and connectome analysis using statistical and AI-based approaches. The goal of the talk is to help familiarize researchers with data considerations, analysis procedures, and challenges in fMRI studies, thereby enabling more statisticians to contribute advanced and well-suited analytical tools for the field.

#### Bio

Dr. [Ying Guo](https://www.yingguo.us/) is Professor in the Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics at Emory University, an appointed Graduate Faculty of the Emory Neuroscience Program and an Associate Faculty in Emory Department of Computer Science. She is a founding member and the current Director of the Center for Biomedical Imaging Statistics (CBIS) at Emory University.  Dr. Guo‚Äôs research focuses on developing analytical methods for neuroimaging and mental health studies. Her main research areas include blind source separation (BSS) methods such as independent component analysis (ICA), brain network and connectome methods, multimodal imaging, longitudinal imaging modeling, and imaging-based prediction methods. Dr. Guo is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association (ASA) and served as the 2023 Chair of the ASA Statistics in Imaging Section. She has served on the editorial boards of several scientific journals in statistics and psychiatry, and also served as a standing member of the NIH Emerging Imaging Technologies in Neuroscience (EITN) study section.

#### Abstract

The field of neuroimaging, particularly **functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)**, is rapidly growing, with over 1,000 new publications annually and widespread use across diverse academic disciplines. As fMRI becomes a core tool for **psychologists**, **neuroscientists**, **physicians**, **economists**, **lawyers**, and **engineers**, understanding its intricacies has never been more critical.

However, the interdisciplinary nature of neuroimaging presents challenges due to its combination of necessary biological, computational, statistical, and psychological expertise. This talk seeks to provide an accessible overview of how fMRI works, focusing on its underlying principles, and explain the variety of techniques used to analyze fMRI data. We will focus on essential conceptual tools to **critically evaluate fMRI studies**, **avoid common pitfalls**, and **deepen the understanding** of this powerful imaging technique.

Our aim is to empower researchers to navigate and assess the complexities of neuroimaging in a rapidly evolving field.
