The National Science Foundation (NSF) has released a solicitation for the Research Training 
Groups in the Mathematical Sciences (RTG) program, a key initiative aimed at bolstering the 
United States' scientific competitiveness by fostering the next generation of mathematical 
sciences professionals. The RTG program encourages US institutions to establish innovative 
research training environments for both graduate and undergraduate students, with an optional 
inclusion of postdoctoral researchers.

## Highlights of the RTG Program for 2024-2025:

- Proposals are invited across all fields within mathematical sciences, particularly those 
  integrating research with emerging areas like Artificial Intelligence, Biotechnology, Quantum 
  Computing, and Cybersecurity.
- Projects are expected to enhance research training and focus on sustained professional 
  development within the mathematical sciences community.

## Proposal Submission and Award Information:

- Full Proposal Deadline: August 13, 2024
- Estimated number of awards: 3 to 10 
- Anticipated funding amount: $400,000 to $600,000 per year, with a total of $12 million 
  available.

## Eligibility Criteria:

- Proposals may be submitted by US-based academic institutions granting doctoral degrees in the 
  mathematical sciences.
- There are no principal investigator (PI) restrictions. However, commitment is taken into 
  account, as an individual cannot serve as PI or co-PI on more than one RTG proposal or award 
  simultaneously.
- Participants, including trainees, must be US citizens, nationals, or permanent residents.

## Application Instructions:

- Proposals must adhere to the NSF Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG).
- Both new and renewal proposals must follow the updated submission guidelines, which reflect 
  changes including optional inclusion of undergraduates and postdocs, new funding alignments, and 
  the latest NSF strategic plan priorities.

This solicitation emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of advanced research training and promotes 
a broad and inclusive approach to education in the mathematical sciences. For more detailed
