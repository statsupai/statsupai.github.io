The **Stats Up AI** group is excited to announce the **“Statistical and AI Methods for Health Data Science”** seminar series. This online seminar series will feature topics in various domains of health data science, including data in **neuroimaging**, **genomics**, **EHRs**, etc. Data analysis in these fields poses significant challenges, encompassing the breadth of **statistics**, **machine learning**, and **AI**. Our series, led by experts in these areas, aims to introduce these challenges, as well as current solutions and data analysis workflows.

**Hope to see many of you!**

Best,

### Hernando Ombao: *Overview of Methods for Characterizing Brain Functional Connectivity*

**Date:** Thursday, June 6, 2025  
**Time:** 11:00 AM – 12:00 PM EST  
**Zoom Registration:** [https://upenn.zoom.us/j/91348715596](https://upenn.zoom.us/j/91348715596)

#### Abstract

Abstract: Modeling dependence between nodes in a brain network is central to understanding underlying neural mechanisms such as perception, action, and memory. In this talk, we present a broad range of statistical methods for characterizing dependence in a brain network. We first review a general framework which decomposes each signal into various frequency components and then characterize the dependence properties through these oscillatory activities. The unifying theme across the talk is to explore the strength of dependence and possible lead-lag dynamics through filtering. The proposed framework is capable of representing both linear and non-linear dependencies that could occur instantaneously or after some delay (lagged dependence).

**In the first part** of the talk, some of the most prominent frequency domain measures such as coherence, partial coherence, and dual-frequency coherence can be derived as special cases under this general framework. Coherence can be viewed  in the proposed framework as the maximal squared correlation between oscillations from a pair of nodes. It gives a more specific information that correlation because it identifies the frequency bands that drive the dependence between nodes.

**In the second part** of the talk, we will discuss methods for characterizing dependence between a pair of communities (of nodes) under the high dimensional setting. Here, we will introduce our proposed Kendall’s Canonical Coherence (KenCoh). The classical method of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is limited to capturing linear associations, cross-sectional studies, and is sensitive to heavy-tailed observations. The proposed KenCoh method mitigates the limitations by using a rank-based approach under elliptic symmetry. It captures non-linear associations and is robust against outliers. The work presented here is limited to multiple independent trials of multivariate time-series, although this is the usual set-up of experimental studies. Future direction of this work will look into potential Markovian dependence of trials which is applicable when trials has sequencing.

**In the third and final part** of the talk, we will briefly describe current work on information-theoretic measures of connectivity. This class of measures are based on joint (and conditional) distributions rather than just the first two moments. The proposed spectral transfer entropy (STE) quantifies the magnitude and direction of information flow from a certain frequency-band oscillation of a channel to an oscillation of another channel. The main advantage of our proposed approach is that it allows adjustments for multiple comparisons to control family-wise error rate. Another novel contribution is a simple yet efficient estimation method based on vine copula theory that enables estimates to capture zero (boundary point) without the need for bias adjustments. With the vine copula representation, a null copula model, which exhibits zero STE, is defined, making significance testing for STE straightforward through a standard resampling approach. Lastly, we illustrate the advantage of our proposed measure through some numerical experiments and provide interesting and novel findings on the analysis of EEG recordings linked to a visual task.

#### Abstract

The field of neuroimaging, particularly **functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)**, is rapidly growing, with over 1,000 new publications annually and widespread use across diverse academic disciplines. As fMRI becomes a core tool for **psychologists**, **neuroscientists**, **physicians**, **economists**, **lawyers**, and **engineers**, understanding its intricacies has never been more critical.

However, the interdisciplinary nature of neuroimaging presents challenges due to its combination of biological, computational, statistical, and psychological expertise. This talk provides an accessible overview of how fMRI works, focusing on its underlying principles and techniques for analyzing fMRI data. Emphasis will be placed on key conceptual tools to **critically evaluate fMRI studies**, **avoid common pitfalls**, and **gain deeper insight** into this powerful imaging technique.

The goal is to equip researchers with the tools needed to navigate and interpret the complexities of neuroimaging in a rapidly evolving field.

#### Abstract

Neuroimaging has been instrumental in enhancing our understanding of healthy brain function and in exploring the neural underpinnings of psychiatric and neurological disorders. Among the many neuroimaging modalities, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is one of the most widely used in contemporary neuroscience.

This talk introduces key analytical techniques and statistical methods for exploring brain function and connectivity through fMRI. It begins with an overview of the nature and structure of fMRI data relevant to modeling, followed by a discussion of modern fMRI analysis techniques—particularly **network and connectome analysis** using statistical and AI tools. The aim is to prepare researchers to engage in fMRI research with a strong understanding of its modeling demands and research opportunities.
