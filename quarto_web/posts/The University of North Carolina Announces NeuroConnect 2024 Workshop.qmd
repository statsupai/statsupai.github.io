# The University of North Carolina Announces NeuroConnect 2024 Workshop

The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will be hosting its celebrated **NeuroConnect 2024** workshop on **August 8-9, 2024**. Set within the scenic Chetola Resort near Blowing Rock, the workshop, a part of UNCâ€™s Education Program of Intelligence and Connectomics (EPIC), is set to bring together a diverse group of brain connectome researchers, including established faculty mentors, junior researchers, and students.

The event will focus on recent developments in the construct of brain connectomes and their statistical analysis, providing a unique opportunity for participants to engage in comprehensive discussions and benefit from practical sessions to advance their research skills.

In addition to fostering academic growth, the workshop offers an idyllic retreat nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains, allowing attendees to immerse themselves in nature and partake in a spectrum of leisure activities combined with relaxing hospitality.

Thanks to a NIH grant, financial aid for travel expenses is available for a selective number of students and junior researchers. This initiative is specifically designed to facilitate the involvement of promising new minds in crucial scientific dialogues.

Keynote speakers at the workshop include renowned experts such as **Paul M. Thompson, PhD**, **Kamil Ugurbil, PhD**, and **John Gilmore, M.D.** They will join a roster of distinguished speakers from various prestigious institutions such as Yale University, University of Washington, University of Pennsylvania, and several others from the University of North Carolina itself.

Applications are encouraged promptly as space is limited, ensuring valuable exchange and networking opportunities for all attendees.

The EPIC team at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is eagerly looking forward to creating an enriching environment conducive to the advancement of brain network research.
