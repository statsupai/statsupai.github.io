  **Introduction:**
  The rapid evolution of flexible and reusable artificial intelligence (AI) models is transforming medical science. We will introduce Causal Generalist Medical AI (Causal GMAI)—a paradigm that integrates causal inference with generalist AI models to enhance interpretability, robustness, and generalizability in medical decision-making. Causal GMAI employs self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised learning on diverse multimodal datasets—including imaging, electronic health records, clinical trials,  laboratory results, genomics, knowledge graphs, and medical text—to perform a wide range of tasks with minimal task-specific supervision. By embedding causal reasoning, these models go beyond prediction to infer underlying causal relationships, improving diagnostic accuracy, treatment recommendations, and personalized medicine. The course covers key technical components such as causal discovery, counterfactual reasoning, and domain adaptation, alongside real-world applications. We will also explore challenges in regulation, validation, and dataset curation to ensure clinical reliability and ethical deployment. Designed for researchers, clinicians, data scientists, and AI practitioners, this course provides a foundation for advancing the next generation of trustworthy and interpretable medical AI.
