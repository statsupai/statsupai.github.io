The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has announced a new funding opportunity, **PAR-25-228**, titled **"Investigator-Initiated Innovation in Computational Genomics and Data Science (R01 Clinical Trial Not Allowed)"**. This program is sponsored by the **National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)** and the **National Library of Medicine (NLM)** and aims to support innovative research in computational genomics, bioinformatics, and data science.

## Key Details

- **Purpose**: This program supports the development of cutting-edge computational, statistical, and bioinformatics tools and methods that enable advances in genomics research with broad applicability to human health and disease.
- **Funding Limits**: Up to **$500,000 in direct costs per year** for a maximum of 5 years.
- **Submission Deadlines**:
  - **First Due Date**: February 5, 2025
  - Additional due dates occur semi-annually in February and June through September 8, 2027.

## Goals of the Program

The program seeks to:
- Foster **highly innovative approaches** for analyzing, processing, and interpreting genomic data.
- Support projects that focus on **scalability, accessibility**, and **interoperability** of tools for genomics research.
- Advance methodologies such as:
  - Tools for **visualizing large genomic datasets**.
  - **AI/ML methods** for genomics, including generative AI and benchmarking.
  - **Privacy-preserving technologies** for genomic data.
  - **Federated learning models** for distributed data analysis.

## Application Instructions

Interested researchers must:
- Follow the guidelines in the [NIH How to Apply - Application Guide](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/how-to-apply-application-guide.html).
