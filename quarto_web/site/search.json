    "title": "Bayesian Learning of COVID-19 Vaccine Safety",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In the COVID-19 pandemic, as a researcher at the University of Michigan, I embarked on a project that stood at the intersection of public health urgency and statistical innovation. My work, titled “Bayesian Learning of COVID-19 Vaccine Safety,” was driven by a critical need: to bolster public confidence in the rapidly developed COVID-19 vaccines.\nWe focus on the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a database with a large number of reports, but with noise and potential over-reporting issues. Recognizing the intricate relationships between different adverse events (AEs), I realized that existing statistical methods fell short in capturing this complexity. It was here that the idea for the Bayesian graph-assisted signal selection (BGrass) model took root.\nBGrass was a pioneering approach, the first of its kind to integrate AE ontology into vaccine-AE disproportionality analyses. The model wasn’t just another statistical tool; it was a novel lens through which the interconnected web of AEs could be viewed and understood. With BGrass, we could simultaneously evaluate the risk of all AEs while acknowledging their interdependencies under a logistic regression framework.\n\nOne of the most challenging aspects was mitigating reporting bias. To address this, I proposed a negative control approach, coupled with an enrichment method to pinpoint AE groups warranting attention. The computational backbone of BGrass was an efficient Gibbs sampler, utilizing Pólya-gamma data augmentation — a method I meticulously developed and made accessible through an R package.\nBut what did all this mean in practical terms? By applying BGrass to over a million VAERS reports, we weren’t just crunching numbers; we were identifying real signals amid the cacophony of data. We pinpointed eight AEs specifically related to COVID-19 vaccines, enhancing our understanding of post-vaccination safety. The accuracy of our estimations of log-odds ratios improved significantly — by up to 35% when abundant ontology information was available.\nThis journey with BGrass was more than a research project; it was a testament to the power of statistical ingenuity in addressing pressing public health challenges. As the world grappled with the uncertainties of a new disease and its vaccines, our work offered a beacon of clarity, contributing to the global effort to ensure vaccine safety and ultimately, to restore public trust in these life-saving tools."

    "text": "Unveiling Immunity Across Cancers: An Interview with Dr. Pei Wang on Her Groundbreaking Research\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n        Dr. Pei Wang\n        Dr. Pei Wang is a Professor of Genetic and Genomic Sciences at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York. She obtained her B.S. in Mathematics from Peking University, China, in 2000; and her Ph.D. in Statistics from Stanford University in 2004. Between 2004-2013, Dr. Wang held faculty positions in the Program of Biostatistics at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Washington, Seattle, WA. In Oct 2013, Dr. Wang joint Icahn Medical School at Mount Sinai, New York.\n        Dr. Wang's research is dedicated to advancing statistical and computational methodologies, translating vast datasets related to diseases such as cancer into meaningful insights to help with patient treatment. She serves as the Principal Investigator of the NCI Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), focusing on unraveling the molecular underpinnings of cancer through extensive proteome and genome analyses. Leading the CPTAC Proteogenomics Data Analysis Center at Mount Sinai, Dr. Wang's team strives to identify potential biomarkers and drug targets for cancer, thereby accelerating progress in cancer research.\n        \n    \n\n    \n    The Article Link:Pan-cancer Proteogenomics Characterization of Tumor Immunity\n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        Regarding the research background and significance, does this work discover new knowledge or solve existing problems within the field? Please elaborate in detail.\n        Dr. Pei Wang: This work discovered new knowledge. \n        In our paper “Pan-Cancer Proteogenomics Characterization of Tumor Immunity” (Cell, 2024, Feb, PMID: 38359819), we integrated DNA, RNA, and proteomics data derived from more than 1,000 tumors across 10 different cancers to reveal the complex interplay of immune and tumor cells. The data came from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), a program under the National Cancer Institute. \n        This work aimed to improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the functional impairment of immune response in tumors. By closely examining genes and proteins in the tumor tissues, we discovered various patterns in immune activation and suppression, and unraveled diverse immune subtypes. \n        \n\n        How did the reviewers evaluate (praise) it?\n        Dr. Pei Wang: The reviewers described the study “current, highly impactful and well developed” with “technical rigor in its methodology and data analysis”, and suggesting that “the key findings advance our understanding of the immune landscape in various cancers and provide potential targets for therapeutic interventions”.\n        \n        If thisachievement has potential applications, what are some specific applications it might have in a few years?\n        Dr. Pei Wang: The findings from the paper can help clinicians to identify patient groups more responsive to immunotherapy. Revealing the specific pathways and cellular switches for each subtype can also spark new and creative ways to develop treatments. For example we nominated a set of kinases that are potential targets for converting cold tumors into hot tumors, thus enhancing their responsiveness to immune-based treatments. We hope some of those leads can be investigated further and be carried out into clinical trials in the future.\n        \n        Can you recount the specific steps or stages from setting the research topic to the successful completion of the research?\n        Dr. Pei Wang: I have been leading a data analysis center for NCI Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) in the past 8 years. Throughout this period, the CPTAC consortium has generated an extensive collection of large-scale, deep proteogenomics data sets. This invaluable resource has offered us a unique opportunity to conduct, for the first time, large-scale (with &gt;1000 tumor samples) proteogenomic analyses to understand the immune landscape across 10 cancer types. Especially, the pan-cancer phosphoproteomics data enables us to comprehensively characterize the kinase activities relating to different immune activation and evasion patterns in tumor samples. This aspect, which has not been extensively explored in prior genomics studies, significantly enhances our understanding of the immune landscape in cancer.\n\n        In this study, unlocking meaningful biological signals from the vast sea of data required meticulous attention to comprehensive data preprocessing, encompassing quality control and harmonization. Employing sophisticated statistical modeling and rigorous inference techniques is also vital to ensure the extraction of genuine and relevant biological insights. Over the course of more than a year, consortium members, comprising multiple teams from different institutions, collaborated to meticulously assemble, quality-check, and harmonize datasets from various CPTAC cancer studies. Confronting challenges inherent in data analysis, we also undertook the development and enhancement of multiple data analysis pipelines to optimize the analytical process.\n        Another important component for the success of the study is that we are able to work very closely with pathologists and clinicians to interpret the results and obtain additional experiment evidence to validate the data analysis results. It’s truly a team work of researchers from different disciplines. \n        \n\n        Were there any memorable events during the research? You can tell a story about anything related to people, events, or objects.\n        Dr. Pei Wang: Unforgettable moments unfolded when unexpected and significant findings emerged from the study. Out of the seven identified subtypes, five encompassed tumors from 10 distinct cancer types, suggesting shared immune responses across these tumors. Additionally, we noted similar kinase activation patterns across different cancers within the same immune subtype. This implies the potential applicability of specific immunotherapy treatments to a broad spectrum of cancer types.                                   \n        Another surprising finding is that, in one subtype (CD8-IFNG+), despite high activity in the IFNG pathway, there was a surprising observation of low immune cell infiltration. This is unexpected, as an active IFNG pathway is typically associated with a robust immune response. Alternative treatment will be needed for this group of patients compared to those from CD8+IFNG+.\n        \n\n        Is there a follow-up plan based on this research? If so, please elaborate.\n        Dr. Pei Wang: We are seeking opportunities to validate our findings through the analysis of cellular level proteomic/transcriptomic data from cutting-edge single-cell platforms. Furthermore, we intend to leverage the insights garnered from this paper in other clinical studies focused on immunotherapy treatment. This effort aims to streamline the development of biomarker panels for treatment responses and identify enhanced treatment strategies. To exemplify, in collaboration with other CPTAC scientists, I am actively involved in a proteogenomic study aimed at unraveling the intricate molecular mechanisms that underlie responses to immune checkpoint treatments in melanoma patients.\n        \n        Without a doubt, AI is one of the hot topics of 2023, requiring extensive data support in its development. What assistance can biostatistics offer to the development of AI?\n        Dr. Pei Wang: I don’t think our work relating to “AI” --- which, in my opinion, involves “self-learning” at real time. But this is definitely a work of BIG data. I believe statisticians play a pivotal role at the forefront, leveraging data to enhance our understanding across a myriad of fields. \n        \n        Besides the above questions, is there anything else about this achievement that you would like to add? If so, please add it below.\n        Dr. Pei Wang: One challenge in cancer research is the extensive sample heterogeneity, both within and across different cancers. With the CPTAC Pan Cancer cohort (&gt;1000), we were more powered to reveal unique subtypes not detected in individual cancer studies. Nevertheless, we may not exhaustively identify every potential immune subtype present in these tumors. Also, tumors may exhibit a spectrum of immune infiltration that defies easy categorization into discrete subtypes.\n        \n        \n\n    \n    \n        Edited by: Shan Gao\n        Proofread by: Hongtu Zhu\n    \n\n\nPage Views:"

My project focuses on how peripheral immune profiles can predict the progression of ALS, measured by the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) score.\nIn collaboration with esteemed neurology experts, I applied unsupervised hierarchical clustering and LASSO-Cox regression models to the clinical dataset. These sophisticated statistical tools, often reserved for the realms of high-end data science, allowed us to unearth patterns that were not immediately apparent. My work wasn’t just about numbers and models. It was about translating these complex findings into a format that could be easily understood by the broader medical community, including those without a statistical background. Using ggplot2, a tool in R for data visualization, I crafted aesthetically pleasing and informative visuals. The implications of this study are profound. By identifying key biomarkers, we’ve taken a significant step towards enhancing the precision of prognostic models for ALS."

    "text": "Bridging Cells and Space: The Journey of scDesign3 Exploration\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    The Article Link:scDesign3 generates realistic in silico data for multimodal single-cell and spatial omics\n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        Regarding the research background and significance, does this work discover new knowledge or solve existing problems within the field? Please elaborate in detail.\n        Our work aimed to provide a unified solution to the problems of method benchmarking and parameter inference in the single-cell and spatial omics field.\n        As breakthrough technologies, single-cell and spatial omics can unprecedentedly provide a multimodal view of the molecular biology phenomena (such as genome-wide gene expression and open chromatin regions) in individual cells. The excitement about these new technologies and the generated massive data has propelled a rapid development of computational methods, leading to thousands of computational methods being developed in less than a decade. As a result, the availability of numerous computational methods makes method benchmarking a pressing challenge. Fair benchmarking demands synthetic data that contain ground truths and mimic real data, thus calling for realistic simulators.\n        Motivated by the critical need for method benchmarking and other tasks (e.g., power analysis) requiring ground truths, my group has developed a series of mode-based single-cell simulators: scDesign (Li and Li, Bioinformatics 2019) and scDesign2 (Sun et al., Genome Biology 2021), with scDesign3 being the latest version. For each simulator, we propose a statistical model to be fitted to real data to describe a multi-variate distribution of cells; then we simulate synthetic cells by sampling from the fitted distribution. For example, for gene expression data, genes are the variables in the multi-variate distribution; for chromatin accessibility data, genomic regions are the variables. The advance of our simulators was based on the improvement of our proposed model. From scDesign to scDesign2, we added the consideration of variable correlations to make the model fit better to real data; as a result, the synthetic data become more realistic. From scDesign2 to the latest scDesign3, the most comprehensive simulator to our knowledge at the time of publication, we enlarged the model to account for comprehensive scenarios, including various cell latent states (discrete cell types or continuous cell trajectories), omics types, spatial locations, and experimental designs (Figure 1 Left).\n        An advantage of scDesign3 is that its probabilistic model unifies the generation and inference for single-cell and spatial omics data. The model’s interpretable parameters and likelihood enable scDesign3 to generate customized synthetic data and unsupervisedly assess the goodness-of-fit of cell latent states inferred by a computational method (Figure 1 Right). Hence, scDesign3 is not only a simulator that can generate realistic synthetic data but also a statistical model that can help interpret real experimental data. By inferring the parameters of the scDesign3 model, we can perform hypothesis testing tasks such as identifying the genes whose expression changes between cell types or along a cell trajectory, as well as comparing gene correlations between cell types.\n \n        \n        \n\n        How did the reviewers evaluate (praise) it?\n        The reviewers acknowledged the timeliness and significance of our work. Their quotes include\n        “Overall, this simulator is timely and invaluable for benchmarking computational methods and interpreting single-cell and spatial omics data.”\n        “The current manuscript scDesign3 proposed a substantial extension from the author’s previous work and addressed some of the key concerns with many current simulation studies; in particular, the capturing of the correlation structure between genes. This manuscript has two key components. The first is the focus on the creation of a generalizable simulation framework and the second component illustrates how the scDesign3 can be applied in three different modelling settings, (i) parameter estimation and inference, (ii) model selection, and (iii) perturbation).”\n        \n\n\n        If this achievement has potential applications, what are some specific applications it might have in a few years?\n        I think realistic synthetic data generation holds promise for critical applications in the single-cell and spatial omics field. First, I have been advocating the inclusion of synthetic negative control data to help users discern spurious discoveries made from a complex analysis pipeline. Such discoveries often arise from artifacts generated by the pipeline due to the “double-dipping” issue, which leads to the confirmatory bias. Second, synthetic data can potentially help alleviate the data imbalance issue, which can negatively affect tasks such as data integration and supervised learning. Third, synthetic data with added perturbations can be used for evaluating the stability of computational results. Given the increasing complexity of data analysis pipelines, involving many user-specified heuristic thresholds across multiple steps, it is essential to ensure the robustness of computational results.\n\n        Can you recount the specific steps or stages from setting the research topic to the successful completion of the research?\n        I will answer this question based on the way we generally conduct research. Before setting a research topic, we always think about three aspects: significance and novelty, validation approaches, and target user base. Given the competitive nature and widespread interest in single-cell and spatial omics, a comprehensive literature review is the cornerstone to justify the novelty and significance of the research topic. Equally important is the deliberation on how to validate the efficacy of our proposed method, whether through computational analysis or experimental verification. We must assess the availability of resources for validation and identify potential collaborators if such resources are lacking. Moreover, we must consider the prospective end-users of our method: will our method be useful for biologists who generate single-cell and spatial omics data, or will it only be interesting to method developers like ourselves? Importantly, how can we persuade biologists, who typically rely on visualization and empirical data, of the utility of our method? In general, I think answering these questions is essential to advocate a computational method to the biomedical scientists. \n        \n\n        Were there any memorable events during the research? You can tell a story about anything related to people, events, or objects.\n        An interesting story is about the term “real data,” used by statisticians in almost every methodology paper. As the scDesign projects were all about “synthetic data,” a term juxtaposed with “real data,” I initially used the term “real data” when introducing our scDesign work to biologists. Surprisingly, some biologists did not understand the concept of \"real data,\" asking questions such as \"What defines real data?\" and \"Is there such a thing as fake data?\" This confusion stemmed from the presumption that all data were generated from experiments and hence qualify as real. Aligned with this confusion, many biologists cannot appreciate the utility of simulation, considering simulation as purely a decoration of a computational method because simulation always works. I think realizing and recognizing these differences in mindsets (e.g., abstract thinking vs. empirical thinking) is an essential first step in fostering collaborations with biomedical scientists.\n        \n\n        Is there a follow-up plan based on this research? If so, please elaborate.\n        We plan to develop an interactive software package for real-data-based synthetic data generation and applications. We will make the package compatible with the state-of-the-art single-cell analysis pipelines Seurat in R and Scanpy in Python. By providing users with the capability to generate customized synthetic data, we hope our software will enable users to benchmark computational methods on their specific datasets, leading to more rigorous and trustworthy discoveries.\n\n        Without a doubt, AI is one of the hot topics of 2023, requiring extensive data support in its development. What assistance can biostatistics offer to the development of AI?\n        I view AI as a technology advance, similar to the advent of computers in the previous century. Statistics transitioned from its pre-computer era, where mathematical methods were the sole tools, to the computer era, where statistical analyses leveraged computing power to tackle previously impossible missions. Regardless of the tool—from mathematics to computers—the core of statistics, how to infer hidden truths from observed data, remains a timeless pursuit. Therefore, I am optimistic that the ongoing development of AI will pave the way for unprecedented advancements in statistical methodologies. I envision a synergy between the feature extraction capabilities of AI and the inferential toolkits of statistics, which can together propel data-driven scientific discovery. \n\n        Besides the above questions, is there anything else about this achievement that you would like to add? If so, please add it below.\n\n        I believe statisticians can play a pivotal role in elucidating the impact of proper versus improper use of statistics on scientific discoveries. Demonstrating the impact on concrete examples could significantly enhance the perceived value and influence of statistics within the scientific community.\n        \n        \n\n    \n    \n        Edited by: Shan Gao\n        Proofread by: Hongtu Zhu\n    \n\n\nPage Views:"

His research interests include quantitative image analysis, real-world data analytics, and clinical machine learning models.\n        \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        Regarding the research background and significance, does this work discover new knowledge or solve existing problems within the field? Please elaborate in detail.\n        The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the use of the updated mRNA vaccines by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech on September 11, 2023 and the use of the updated adjuvanted vaccine by Novavax on October 3, 2023, “to provide better protection against serious consequences of COVID-19, including hospitalization and death”, without providing any clinical evidence. The updated vaccines contain a monovalent component of the Omicron XBB.1.5 subvariant. By the time these vaccines were deployed, XBB.1.5 subvariant was no longer prevalent. The effectiveness of the updated vaccines against currently circulating subvariants was unknown.\n        Meanwhile, the American College of Physicians has recommended ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) and molnupiravir, without ranking, for outpatient treatment of symptomatic COVID-19 patients at high risk of progressing to severe disease, whereas the National Institutes of Health Guidelines prefers nirmatrelvir. It would be helpful for physicians and patients to know which recommendation should be followed. In addition, it would be important to determine whether the decision to take antiviral drugs should depend on whether or not the patient had received an updated vaccine.\n        Against these backdrops, our paper provided much-needed clinical data from a large cohort study on the effectiveness of the three updated XBB.1.5 vaccines and the two oral antiviral drugs, as well as their interactions, against admission to hospital and death from currently circulating Omicron subvariants.1 We showed that both XBB.1.5 vaccines and antiviral drugs reduced the risk of serious consequences of infection with currently circulating Omicron subvariants. The effectiveness of updated XBB.1.5 vaccines was similar among patients aged ≥65 years and those aged &lt; 65 years, but the risks of hospitalization and death were much higher in the older age group. The effectiveness was higher in immunocompromised patients, who are at elevated risk of disease progression, than immunocompetent patients. In addition, the effects of molnupiravir and Paxlovid on disease progression were similar. Finally, the effectiveness of antiviral drugs was similar between recipients and non-recipients of the updated XBB.1.5 vaccines.\n \n        \n\n\n        How did the reviewers evaluate (praise) it?\n        The reviewers praised the timely and important nature of our work, as well as the clarity of our presentation:\n        “This is a timely report and answers important questions on the effectiveness of the XBB.1.5 boosters.” \n        “This concise, clearly written paper investigates the protective effect among PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases of XBB.1.5 vaccination, and separately of antiviral drug treatment with nirmatrelvir or molnupiravir, against progression of COVID-19 disease to hospitalization and death.”\n        “The paper is timely and addresses an important topic.”\n        The Editor-in-Chief wrote to us: “These are Important data, so I’m happy we get to publish them.”\n\n        \n\n\n        If this achievement has potential applications, what are some specific applications it might have in a few years?\n        Our work has important implications for the prevention and intervention strategies against COVID-19. Specifically, updated XBB.1.5 vaccines should be considered by all individuals, especially those who are aged 65 years or older or are immunocompromised, and either molnupiravir or Paxlovid can be prescribed to patients with COVID-19 who are at high risk of progressing to severe disease, regardless of their XBB.1.5 vaccination status.\n\n        Can you recount the specific steps or stages from setting the research topic to the successful completion of the research?\n        We recognized the importance of the research topic before the updated XBB.1.5 vaccines were authorized by the FDA. However, we had to wait for the updated vaccines to be deployed for several months to analyze the data, because we needed a large number of vaccine recipients and sufficient follow-up in order to obtain stable and precise estimates of the effects of updated vaccines on hospitalization and death. On the other hand, we wanted to publish our work as soon as possible, so as to maximize its impact.  Thus, there was a delicate balance in the timing of this research. \n        \n\n        Were there any memorable events during the research? You can tell a story about anything related to people, events, or objects.\n        This paper was published extremely fast, especially compared to a statistical publication. We submitted our paper on February 1, and the Editor-in-Chief sent the paper out to external reviewers on the same day. We received the initial decision on February 19 and were given 2 weeks to revise the manuscript. We submitted our revised manuscript in one week, and it was accepted in a few hours. We received the galley proof two days later. The paper was published a week later, on March 4.\n        \n\n        Is there a follow-up plan based on this research? If so, please elaborate.\n        This study evaluated the effectiveness of updated vaccines and antiviral drugs against progression from infection to severe disease (hospitalization and death). We plan to evaluate the effectiveness of updated vaccines against infection, as well as the effectiveness of vaccination and (outpatient) antiviral treatment on long-COVID.\n\n        Without a doubt, AI is one of the hot topics of 2023, requiring extensive data support in its development. What assistance can biostatistics offer to the development of AI?\n        Biostatistics offers indispensable support to the development of AI by providing rigorous analytical frameworks necessary to generate actionable insights from data, particularly in the context of electronic health records. Data quality is the key to the development of clinical AI models. Rigorous biostatistical methods should be employed to collect and process data.\n\n        Besides the above questions, is there anything else about this achievement that you would like to add? If so, please add it below.\n\n        Statisticians should be more involved in translational research, which allows statisticians to directly address practical challenges and solve real-world problems faced by practitioners. By developing and applying statistical methods to various scientific settings, statisticians can directly advance scientific knowledge.\n        \n        \n\n    \n    \n        Edited by: Shan Gao\n        Proofread by: Hongtu Zhu\n    \n\n\nPage Views:"
