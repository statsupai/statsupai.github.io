<p>Bulk RNA-seq is still the workhorse of cancer transcriptomics—especially for large cohorts with clinical outcomes. But tumors are mixtures: malignant cells, immune cells, and stroma all speak at once, and bulk data records their <em>chorus</em>, not each <em>voice</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Transcriptomic deconvolution</strong> is the set of methods that tries to separate that chorus into interpretable parts: <em>who is present</em> (cell-type proportions) and, increasingly, <em>what each component is expressing</em> (cell-type–specific profiles).</p>
<p>This post is based on an interview with the authors of a Nature Reviews Cancer review that cataloged <strong>43 deconvolution methods</strong>—and then did something more useful than a leaderboard: it built a <strong>workflow</strong> for choosing methods responsibly in cancer.</p>
<section id="the-uncomfortable-truth-best-method-is-usually-the-wrong-question" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-uncomfortable-truth-best-method-is-usually-the-wrong-question">The uncomfortable truth: “best method” is usually the wrong question</h2>
<p>If you’ve ever searched “best deconvolution method,” you’ve already felt the problem: answers rarely match your data, your references, your cancer type, or your downstream claim.</p>
<p>The authors described a key turning point while writing the review: they <em>tried</em> to rank methods, then kept finding exceptions—until the ranking tables became meaningless. The honest conclusion was simple:</p>
<p><strong>Performance depends on context.</strong><br>
What references you have, what cell types you care about, and what you want to infer all change what “good” looks like.</p>
<p>So they replaced rankings with a <strong>decision-tree framework</strong>: a way to pick a method class that fits <em>your</em> situation.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-cancer-is-not-just-another-tissue" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-cancer-is-not-just-another-tissue">Why cancer is not “just another tissue”</h2>
<p>Many deconvolution methods were developed (and validated) in settings where “cell types” are relatively stable and references transfer cleanly. Cancer breaks those assumptions in at least three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tumor cell plasticity:</strong> malignant programs shift with microenvironment and therapy.</li>
<li><strong>Extreme heterogeneity:</strong> mixtures can be more complex than typical benchmarks.</li>
<li><strong>The “missing reference” problem:</strong> we often lack reference profiles that capture dynamic malignant states.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why a cancer-specific guide matters: it isn’t only about computing proportions—it’s about avoiding confident claims that the data cannot support.</p>
</section>
<section id="before-you-pick-a-method-answer-these-two-questions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="before-you-pick-a-method-answer-these-two-questions">Before you pick a method, answer these two questions</h2>
<p>Most practical choices reduce to two decisions:</p>
<section id="what-is-your-target-output" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-your-target-output">1) What is your target output?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cell composition</strong>: proportions of immune/stromal/tumor-related populations<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Cell-type–specific expression</strong>: deconvolved profiles for tumor and/or microenvironment<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Both</strong> (harder than it sounds; requires stronger assumptions and validation)</li>
</ul>
<p>Be explicit. Many misinterpretations start when a tool output is treated as something it was never designed to estimate.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-reference-information-do-you-actually-have" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-reference-information-do-you-actually-have">2) What reference information do you actually have?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single-cell reference available</strong> (ideally tumor-matched; sometimes tumor-adjacent)</li>
<li><strong>Partial reference / semi-reference</strong> (some anchors, but not a full atlas)</li>
<li><strong>No reliable reference</strong> (reference-free / unsupervised approaches)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where the review’s decision tree earns its keep: it guides you to a method <em>family</em> that matches your reference reality, instead of forcing a one-size-fits-all choice.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="a-practical-workflow-you-can-run-with" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-practical-workflow-you-can-run-with">A practical workflow you can run with</h2>
<p>A useful deconvolution analysis is not “run tool → get numbers.” It’s closer to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Define your claim up front</strong><br>
What would you conclude if the result looks strong? What would change your mind?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Choose the method class using your constraints</strong><br>
Start from reference availability and target output—then narrow within that class.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stress-test assumptions, not just accuracy</strong><br>
Ask what happens when:</p>
<ul>
<li>key cell populations are rare,</li>
<li>malignant states are plastic,</li>
<li>batch effects differ between reference and target data.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Validate with orthogonal signals</strong><br>
If a result matters, it deserves at least one independent sanity check: pathology estimates, marker genes, known biology, paired modalities, or other corroborating evidence.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Report uncertainty and limitations like first-class results</strong><br>
A point estimate without uncertainty invites overclaiming. A limitations paragraph written early prevents you from “discovering” certainty later.</p></li>

<section id="what-the-review-enables-immediately" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-the-review-enables-immediately">What the review enables immediately</h2>
<p>The authors emphasized a near-term payoff: <strong>re-analyzing existing bulk datasets</strong> (e.g., TCGA-scale cohorts) to extract tumor microenvironment composition and tumor-specific signals—sometimes discovering biomarkers without generating new data.</p>
<p>They also pointed to an important sign of maturity: clinical trials are starting to incorporate deconvolution-derived metrics as <strong>secondary outcomes</strong>. That’s not “routine clinical use” yet—but it’s a real bridge from method papers to practice.</p>
</section>
<section id="where-the-field-is-going-next" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="where-the-field-is-going-next">Where the field is going next</h2>
<p>The review highlights several directions that would materially expand what deconvolution can do in cancer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FFPE-compatible deconvolution</strong> to unlock massive clinical archives</li>
<li><strong>Temporal models</strong> to track composition and programs during treatment</li>
<li><strong>Multi-modal integration</strong> (e.g., copy number, methylation) to reduce ambiguity</li>
<li><strong>Spatial transcriptomics extensions</strong> to connect “who is present” with “where they are” and “who interacts with whom”</li>
</ul>
<p>The authors also mentioned active follow-ups: practical tutorials (how to build cancer-specific references, interpret outputs, and avoid pitfalls) and collaborations to generate <strong>matched bulk + single-cell</strong> datasets for better benchmarking—still rare, but crucial.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="behind-the-scenes-what-made-this-review-actionable-instead-of-exhaustive">Behind the scenes: what made this review “actionable” instead of “exhaustive”</h2>
<p>Two choices shaped the review’s tone and usefulness:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Problem-first organization:</strong> the guide is structured around the biological questions cancer researchers face, not around method taxonomy.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency over marketing:</strong> documenting limitations (and even excluded methods) was extra work, but it prevents the review from becoming a hype vehicle.</li>
</ul>
<p>One surprise that influenced their emphasis: despite years of algorithm development, relatively few clinical trials use deconvolution beyond exploratory analyses—so the true bottleneck is often <strong>translation</strong>, not sophistication.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="biostatistics-ai-the-missing-layer-in-many-method-discussions">Biostatistics × AI: the missing layer in many method discussions</h2>
<p>“AI performance” can look impressive on paper, especially on simulated mixtures. The authors framed biostatistics as the discipline that forces reality checks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do metrics reflect <em>tumor</em> complexity, not convenient benchmarks?</li>
<li>Do results generalize across cancer types and cohorts?</li>
<li>Where is the uncertainty quantification—especially if outputs might influence decisions?</li>
<li>Are we detecting batch effects, reference mismatch, and systematic bias before a model “learns” them?</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words: biostatistics is how deconvolution becomes trustworthy, not just clever.</p>
