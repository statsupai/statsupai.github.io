# StatsUpAI Website 🧩


This repo powers the **StatsUpAI website**, and it’s a *hybrid* site:

- **Raw HTML** for many “classic” pages (hand-written `.html` files)
- **Jekyll** for the **Events** section (so you can list webinars, filter by year, etc.)
- **Quarto** for most **Community News / Interviews** (long-form posts)

If you’re new to web maintenance (or you just want a low-stress workflow), the key idea is:

> **You can install Jekyll and use `make preview` to see the whole site locally** (including raw HTML + Quarto-built pages), even if you’re not actively editing the Jekyll part.

## Big picture: what lives where?

Here are latest versions of the three directory trees that reflect how the repository is actually organized:

### 1) Raw HTML (hand‑written pages)

These files live at the root and rely on their own asset folders like `css`, `js` and `img`.  The root `assets/` directory is **not** used by these pages; instead, classic pages reference stylesheets under `css/` (e.g., `css/bootstrap.min.css`), scripts under `js/` and images under `img/`.

```
statsupai.github.io/
├── index.html
├── team.html
├── pipeline.html
├── pages/
│   ├── Proteogenomics.html
│   ├── (other topic pages).html
│   └── ...
├── css/        # stylesheets for classic pages (e.g., bootstrap, flexslider):contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
├── js/         # scripts for classic pages (e.g., jQuery, bootstrap):contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
├── img/        # images used by classic pages (logos, slide images):contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
└── ...
```

### 2) Jekyll‑generated (Events section)

The Events section is generated by Jekyll from Markdown files and templates.  Jekyll places its assets (stylesheets, scripts, images) under a root `assets/` folder rather than using the `css/`, `js/` and `img/` directories of the classic pages.  A typical layout therefore looks like this:

```
statsupai.github.io/
├── _config.yml
├── assets/     # Jekyll assets (images, css, js)
│   ├── images/
│   ├── css/
│   └── js/
├── _includes/
│   └── ... (navbar/footer bits)
├── _layouts/
│   └── ... (page templates)
├── events/
│   ├── webinars/
│   │   └── index.md
│   ├── (other event categories)/
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

### 3) Quarto‑generated (Community News posts)

Quarto sources are stored under `quarto_web/posts/`, and the rendered site (HTML) is output into `quarto_web/site/`.  This structure hasn’t changed, but note that the compiled site may contain its own asset folders generated by Quarto.

```
statsupai.github.io/
├── quarto_web/
│   ├── _quarto.yml
│   ├── posts/                 # source .qmd files
│   │   ├── (post).qmd
│   │   └── ...
│   └── site/                  # output compiled website
│       ├── posts/
│       │   ├── (post).html
│       │   └── ...
│       └── ...               # Quarto-generated assets live here
└── ...
```

## Quickstart (macOS)

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>
   cd statsupai.github.io
   ```

2. **Install the local preview toolchain (Ruby + Jekyll gems)**

   ```bash
   make setup-macos
   ```

3. **Start local preview (live reload)**

   ```bash
   make preview

## Terminal Commands Shortcuts

As defined in `Makefile` (placed at the repo root), here are common commands bundled for you:

| What you want                           | Command              |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Start local preview (fast)              | `make preview`       |
| Clean + rebuild preview (more reliable) | `make rebuild`       |
| Clean caches/output                     | `make clean`         |
| One-time mac setup                      | `make setup-macos`   |
| Windows setup instructions              | `make setup-windows` |

Feel free to open `Makefile` to see more commands or customize as needed.

## How to publish

Usually, the public website updates when you **push commits to GitHub**, and GitHub Pages / CI builds and deploys automatically.

Common flow:

1. Commit your changes
2. Push to a branch (default as `main`)
3. GitHub builds + deploys for you (usually within a few minutes); see [Actions](https://github.com/statsupai/statsupai.github.io/actions) tab for build status
4. Visit https://statsupai.org etc. to see the changes live

## When stuff breaks (fast fixes) 🔧

### Ruby / Bundler errors

```bash
bundle install
make preview
```

If it still complains:

```bash
make clean
bundle install
make preview
```

### Port 4000 already in use

Something else is running a server.

* Stop the other server and rerun:

  ```bash
  make preview
  ```

### Pages not updating / stale output

```bash
make clean
make rebuild
```

### “Missing gem” / “cannot load such file”

```bash
bundle install
make preview
```

### Works on GitHub but not locally

Try the “reset everything” sequence:

```bash
make clean
bundle install
make rebuild
```

## Contributing workflow (easiest way)

If you prefer to avoid the `git` command line entirely, you can handle commits through [**GitHub Desktop**](https://desktop.github.com/), which provides a friendly graphical interface that you can just point-and-click.

After installing GitHub Desktop and cloning the repository, follow these simple steps to commit and push your updates:

1. **Open the repository** in GitHub Desktop (clone or add the local folder).
2. After editing files, the **Changes** tab will list modified files.
3. Enter a concise **summary** in the commit message box and (optionally) a longer description underneath.
4. Click **Commit to main** to record your change, then click **Push origin** to sync it to the remote.

This workflow keeps things simple—edit, commit, push—and GitHub Desktop takes care of the underlying Git commands for you.

### Tips (healthy commits)

> Small commits + focused themes = easy rollback + less panic! 🎉

## FAQ

**Q: Is this a Jekyll site or not?**

A: It’s a **hybrid**. Many pages are raw HTML, Events are Jekyll-generated, and Community News is mostly Quarto-generated.

**Q: Why suggest installing Jekyll if lots of pages aren’t Jekyll?**

A: Because Jekyll gives you the easiest **one-command local preview** (`make preview`) that serves the whole site together.

**Q: Where do I edit a classic page like “Team” or “Pipeline”?**

A: Edit the raw HTML file directly (e.g., `team.html`, `pipeline.html`, or files under `pages/`).

**Q: Where do I edit Events / Webinars?**

A: Under `events/` (typically one Markdown file per event) + templates in `_layouts/` and `_includes/`.

**Q: Where do I edit Community News posts?**

A: Usually edit the Quarto source `.qmd` files (often under `quarto_web/posts/`), then render to update `quarto_web/site/posts/*.html`.

**Q: What should I NOT edit?**

A: Don’t edit `_site/` (generated output). If something keeps regenerating after preview/rebuild, treat it as output.
