                    <p>
                        The work both uncovers new knowledge and addresses longstanding challenges in biomedical research. Here are multiple perspectives:

                        1. Novel Discovery of Knowledge
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The paper introduces iKraph—a knowledge graph constructed by processing all PubMed abstracts with a pipeline that achieves human-level accuracy. This effort goes beyond traditional manual curation by integrating 10+ million entities and over 30 million relations, thereby revealing novel associations and insights not captured in existing public databases. By aggregating and interpreting vast amounts of literature, the method uncovers previously hidden or underappreciated relationships (e.g., between diseases, genes, and drugs) that can inspire new hypotheses and research directions.

                        2. Solving Existing Methodological Problems
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The study addresses a critical bottleneck in biomedical informatics: the extraction of structured, reliable knowledge from unstructured text. Traditional approaches struggled with scale and accuracy, but this work leverages advanced natural language processing and a winning pipeline from the LitCoin NLP Challenge to meet these challenges head-on. The development of the probabilistic semantic reasoning (PSR) algorithm is particularly noteworthy—it provides an interpretable framework for inferring indirect causal relationships, a task that has proven challenging with earlier methods. This directly tackles the problem of making sense of complex, multi-hop relations in biomedical data.
                    </p>

                    <p class="section-title">
                        3. Impact on Applications like Drug Repurposing
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The integration of diverse data sources and the ability to infer causal pathways allow the system to generate actionable insights, as demonstrated by its application in real-time drug repurposing studies (e.g., for COVID-19 and cystic fibrosis). This not only speeds up hypothesis generation but also improves the rigor of validation compared to traditional approaches. The work shows that structured, high-quality knowledge graphs can be directly used to predict and validate novel therapeutic candidates—bridging a gap that manual literature reviews and less sophisticated automated systems have struggled to close.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Overall, the study exemplifies a paradigm shift: it both discovers new biomedical insights by mining and integrating massive amounts of data, and it provides robust solutions to longstanding challenges in automated knowledge extraction and hypothesis generation.

                    <p>
                        The reviewers were generally very positive about the work, highlighting several aspects that set it apart:

                    <p>
                        They praised the sheer scale of the knowledge extraction—processing over 34 million PubMed abstracts and integrating data from 40 public databases and high-throughput genomics analyses—which provides a much richer and more comprehensive resource than previous efforts. The integration of diverse data sources was seen as a major strength, establishing a solid foundation for advanced biomedical insights.

                        Both reviewers commended the use of an advanced information extraction pipeline (the LitCoin Challenge-winning system) that achieves human-level performance. The development of the probabilistic semantic reasoning (PSR) framework was especially highlighted for its interpretability. Unlike many “black-box” models, PSR allows experts to trace the reasoning behind inferred indirect relationships, which is critical for applications such as drug repurposing.

                    <p>
                        The system’s performance in drug repurposing studies—demonstrating high recall rates in case studies for COVID-19 and cystic fibrosis—was seen as compelling evidence of its practical utility in accelerating therapeutic discovery. The retrospective validation showing that many viable drug candidates could have been identified early (for example, during the COVID-19 pandemic) impressed the reviewers, suggesting real-world impact.

                        Reviewer #1 noted that while no single element might be entirely novel, the integrated system as a whole represents a significant advancement in automated biomedical knowledge extraction and inference. Reviewer #2 emphasized the KG’s value for the biomedical community, especially given that many existing KGs are outdated, and appreciated the efforts to provide both a server interface and downloadable data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In summary, the reviewers evaluated the work as a credible and meaningful step forward in biomedical informatics—combining scale, methodological rigor, and interpretability to deliver a resource with clear applications in accelerating research and drug discovery.

                    <p>
                        The achievement paves the way for several transformative applications in biomedical research and healthcare. For instance:

                    <p>
                        The system’s ability to infer indirect causal relations can be further refined to rapidly identify novel drug candidates or repurpose existing ones, particularly for emerging diseases. Future iterations could integrate real-time data feeds to continuously update predictions, enabling faster response during health crises.

                        1. Historical Foundation and Early Vision
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We began with a long-held vision of using knowledge graphs for automated knowledge discovery. Our journey started in 2011 with our PLOS One paper, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0021474" class="highlight">
                            “Integrated Bio-Entity Network: A System for Biological Knowledge Discovery”
                        </a>, which laid the conceptual groundwork for today’s approach—even though back then we did not use the term “knowledge graph.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At that time, our extraction methods were more rudimentary, and the quality of the information extracted was not comparable to what is achievable now.
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-title">
                        2. Advancements in Technology and Methodology
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With the emergence of deep learning and large language models (LLMs), we revamped our approach by developing an award-winning, human-level information extraction pipeline. This new system could accurately extract multiple critical biological entities and their relationships from vast datasets, enabling us to construct a comprehensive, high-quality knowledge graph.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Recognizing that understanding causal directions is key for generating actionable hypotheses, we took an extra step to manually annotate causal information and build a causal knowledge graph.

                    <p class="section-title">

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A pivotal stage was the creation of our probabilistic semantic reasoning (PSR) algorithm. This probabilistic framework allowed us to infer indirect causal relationships at scale, generating interpretable hypotheses from our graph.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also implemented a time-sensitive validation strategy. By retrospectively testing our generated hypotheses against evolving data, we rigorously demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of our overall approach.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each of these stages—from the initial conceptualization to technological enhancement, algorithm development, and rigorous validation—played an essential role in the successful completion of the research.

                    <p>
                        Our journey was full of ups and downs that ultimately enriched our research story:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We initially submitted the manuscript to top-tier journals like <span class="highlight">Nature</span> and <span class="highlight">Science</span>, only to face rejections without even reaching peer review—and <span class="highlight">Nature Biotechnology</span> also passed us by. That period was very disheartening, and for a while, we felt too frustrated to continue submitting to similar outlets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, rather than giving up, we decided to persevere and submitted the work to <span class="highlight">Nature Machine Intelligence</span>. This time, our efforts paid off, and the manuscript was accepted—a turning point that reaffirmed our belief in the value of our approach.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Along the way, one of the most memorable surprises was discovering that our method could repurpose a remarkably large number of drugs and diseases, each backed by substantial literature evidence. Reading through these supporting pieces of evidence made us realize the immense potential of our work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the same time, the process also revealed a critical insight: while our predictions were exciting, many repurposed drug candidates were not ideal due to simple, overlooked factors. This observation has already set the stage for our next phase of research, where reducing the false positive rate will be a key focus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Earlier milestones, such as winning the <span class="highlight">LitCoin NLP Challenge</span> and <span class="highlight">BioCreative challenges</span>, also played pivotal roles in building our confidence and shaping the direction of our study. These successes, along with many precious memories from our collaborative efforts, continue to inspire us—even if I won’t elaborate on all those details here.

                    <p>
                        This rollercoaster of rejections, surprising discoveries, and key milestones not only defined our research journey but also reinforced the resilience and creativity required to drive innovation in biomedical knowledge discovery.
